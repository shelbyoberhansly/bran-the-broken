        Forgive my manners. I don't see many ladies these days. Lucky for the
        ladies. The tourney of Ashford Meadows. I would like a trial by combat.
        A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad act the good. Each
        should have its own reward.

        King in the North. The night is dark and full of terrors. The Knight of
        Lemonwood. The Knight of Lemonwood. A dream of Spring. The rains of
        castamere. Dunc the Lunk, thick as a castle wall. A forked purple
        lightning bolt, on black field speckled with four-pointed stars. The
        rains of castamere. You know nothing, Jon Snow.

        <li>This is a counterpoint!</li>
        <li>
          But holy $#!%, <strong>this</strong> argument blows the other
          arguments away.
        </li>
        <li>
          And now this argument means the first two arguments are disproven af.
